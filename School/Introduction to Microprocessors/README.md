Introduction to Microprocessors

My first class on microprocessors and microcontrollers, it built on my knowledge
of assembly from introduction to assembly language programming. In this class
we learned how to program the pic16f887 using assembly.

Every lab built upon the same circuit, as such I breadborded and debugged
every circuit on real hardware.
